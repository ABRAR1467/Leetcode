Intuition :
Use a set to dynamically store unique AND results of subarrays ending at each element to efficiently track potential candidates.
For each element, compute new AND values by combining it with all previous AND results and itself, updating the set.
Continuously check and update the minimum absolute difference between 𝑘
and these AND values to find the optimal subarray.
